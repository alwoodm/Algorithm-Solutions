## Solutions

In this directory, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem number. Some of these solutions were written a long time ago, so the code may not be perfect. I prefer to focus on solving new problems rather than revisiting older solutions.

> **Note:** The statement for any LeetCode problem can be found at [https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-name/](https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-name/), where `problem-name` is the problem name written in lowercase with hyphens.
