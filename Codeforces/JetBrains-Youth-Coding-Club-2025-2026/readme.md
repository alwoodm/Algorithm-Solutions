# JetBrains Youth Coding Club 2025/2026

## About the Club

JetBrains Youth Coding Club is a free online club for high school students (ages 13-19) from around the world who want to develop their competitive programming skills [web:2]. The club runs for the 2025/2026 season from October 2025 to May 2026 [web:2].

The club's program focuses not so much on algorithm theory, but on practical problem-solving in real competition conditions [web:6]. The club instructor is **Pavel Mavrin** – 2004 ICPC World Champion, 2002 IOI Silver Medalist, and instructor at JetBrains Academy [web:3].

## Program Format

The club offers a comprehensive skill development program:

- **Weekly Codeforces contests** – mashups of problems from previous competitions, carefully selected by the instructor [web:3]
- **Live sessions on Thursdays** – weekly live sessions with Pavel Mavrin, where solutions to problems are discussed [web:2]
- **Discord community** – platform for communication with instructors and other club participants [web:2]
- **JetBrains Certificate** – participants can earn a Certificate of Achievement [web:2]
