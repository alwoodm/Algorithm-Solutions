## About the Platform

Szkopul.edu.pl is a Polish competitive programming platform primarily used for algorithmic education and contests. Created and maintained by the Polish Olympiad in Informatics committee, it serves as a hub for programming competitions and training in Poland, including the Polish Olympiad in Informatics (POI) and other national and local competitions.

## Key Features

- **Educational Focus**: Strong emphasis on educational aspects of competitive programming
- **Contest Platform**: Hosts the Polish Olympiad in Informatics and other competitions
- **Problem Sets**: Organized collections of problems by topic and difficulty
- **Judging System**: Reliable automatic evaluation system for submitted solutions

## Problem Types

The platform offers various categories of problems including:

- Data structures
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy algorithms
- Computational geometry
- Search algorithms
- Number theory
- String processing

## Solutions

In this directory, you'll find my solutions to various Szkopul problems, organized by problem identifier.

Currently, the directory contains only the **pti** folder, which includes problems created on the Szkopul platform as part of school education. The problems are grouped by the dates they were solvedâ€”each folder named with a date contains the corresponding problems. Many files may have Polish-sounding names, as the code was written for school learning purposes and I study and live in Poland.
