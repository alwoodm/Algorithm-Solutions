# Triangle Perimeter

## Problem Description
For given lengths of the sides of a triangle, calculate its perimeter.

## Input
In the first line of input, there are three integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) - the lengths of the sides of the triangle. You can assume that it will always be possible to build a triangle from the given side lengths.

## Output
The perimeter of the triangle.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9
- Available memory: 32MB
