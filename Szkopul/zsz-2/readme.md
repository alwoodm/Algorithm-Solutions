# Adjacent Character Swap

Write a program that reads n words and swaps adjacent characters in each word: the first character with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on. If the number of characters in a word is odd, the last character remains in place.

## Input
- First line: integer n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000) - number of words
- Next n lines: one word per line, containing lowercase Latin letters (length: 1-1000 characters)

## Output
For each input word, output a line containing the word with adjacent characters swapped.

## Example
```
Input:
3
abcabc
xyztw
aaaa

Output:
baaccb
yxtzw
aaaa
```
