## Middle Number

Write a program that reads triplets of integers and for each triplet outputs the middle number (by value). For example, for the triplet (3, 2, 4), the program should output 3.

### Input
The first line of input contains an integer from the range 1 to 1000 - this is the number of triplets to read. Each of the following n lines contains three integers from the range −2·10^9 to 2·10^9. There are single spaces between the numbers in each line.

### Output
For each read triplet, the program should output a line of text containing the middle number (i.e., the one that would be in the middle if the three numbers were arranged in non-decreasing order).

### Example
For the input:
```
3
3 2 4
44 66 55
5 7 5
```

The correct output is:
```
3
55
5
```
