**Available memory:** 32MB

Johnny is learning to add multi-digit numbers from right to left, one digit at a time. For Johnny, a carry operation, during which a 1 is carried from one position to the next, presents a serious challenge. Your task is to count how many carry operations will occur in each addition in a given set. This will help Johnny estimate the difficulty of the tasks.

## Input
The first line of input contains the number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) - the number of test cases.
Each of the next n lines contains two unsigned integers, each having fewer than 18 digits.

## Output
For each of the n sets of numbers, output the number of carry operations that occur when adding the two numbers.

## Example
**Input:**
```
3
234 342
654 456
191 111
```

**Output:**
```
0
3
